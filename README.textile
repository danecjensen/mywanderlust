h1. Wanderlust

I built the app as a way to help organize travel plans among multiple people.  It's pretty basic right now its just a board of destinations shared between people. You can check it out at "mywanderlust.co":http://mywanderlust.co.
Here's an example trip I made:
"http://mywanderlust.co/trips/c8b8d9b3444c2dce21fcf12063101b77a93c30f6/edit":http://mywanderlust.co/trips/c8b8d9b3444c2dce21fcf12063101b77a93c30f6/edit

Here's my profile with multiple trips I want to go on:
"http://mywanderlust.co/users/2":http://mywanderlust.co/users/2

Please try to plan a trip with it and share the trip with people and tell me what would make the app more useful.
